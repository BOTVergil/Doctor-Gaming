This mod requires TerraGuardians Mod and ArknightsMod installed to work.

Welcome to AI Operator Mods, these characters are from Arkights and have an elite system and dialogue, although they are still in a semi-finished state.
1.They can engage in battles or sell items through commands.
2.They can use most weapons and equipment.
3.ACE and Scout appear here, but they are trapped by King Slim.
4.Your cat being killed will cause Jessica to move in.
5.Jessica won't give you any money.
Currently, it is still in a semi-finished state.

Do you just want these guys and no Guardians? You can have just these guys with no guardians by disabling "Enable Mod Companions to spawn" in the TerraGuardians config.
